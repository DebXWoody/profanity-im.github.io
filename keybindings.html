            <h3>GNU Readline</h3>

            <p>
                Since version 0.4.7 Profanity uses <a target="_blank" href="https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU Readline</a> for handling input. GNU Readline comes with many features including customisable key bindings, and Emacs or Vi editing modes.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more information on key bindings and customisations available in GNU Readline, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rluserman.html">guide</a>. Taken from the above guide, below is a list of basic bindings that come with GNU Readline by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                 In the following table <code>C-k</code> means Control-k, <code>M-k</code> means Meta-k where the meta key may differ depending on your OS (alt key, windows key, command key etc).
