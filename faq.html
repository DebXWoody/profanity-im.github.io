            <a name="why"></a>
            <h4>Why another console based XMPP client?</h4>
            <p>Profanity was originally written for two main reasons. Firstly, the author wanted something similar to Irssi, but with a focus on XMPP for use in his workplace. Secondly, it was a bit of fun and a learning exercise.</p>
            <p>Profanity is still a young project and there are plenty of good alternatives out there (although of course we'd love you to use Profanity), see the list at <a href="http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/">xmpp.org</a>.</p>

            <a name="platform"></a>
            <h4>Will Profanity run on &ltsome platform&gt?</h4>
            <p>Profanity should run on any POSIX system, see the <a href="install.html">install guide</a> for specifics.</p>

            <a name="gtalk"></a>
            <h4>Will Profanity work with Google Talk, or Facebook chat?</h4>
            <p>Both Google Talk and Facebook chat have been tested successfully.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="msn"></a>
            <h4>Will Profanity work with MSN/Yahoo/AIM/IRC etc?</h4>
            <p>No, Profanity is purely an XMPP chat client.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="multiaccount"></a>
            <h4>Can I connect to more than one account at a time?</h4>
            <p>No, the recommended way is to use multiple terminal windows, or GNU Screen.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="termf1"></a>
            <h4>Why does the F1 key open terminal help rather than going back to the main console window?</h4>
            <p>Some terminals have a key binding for F1 to open help. You can use the alt-num keys to change windows, or if you prefer to use the F keys, you'll need to change the terminal setting to open help with another key.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="selecttext"></a>
            <h4>How can I select text from Profanity to copy to the clipboard?</h4>
            <p>You have to hold the shift key down to select text with the mouse.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="notify"></a>
            <h4>Why don't the desktop notifications work for me?</h4>
            <p>Desktop notifications are currently only supported on Linux (for which you need libnotify available during compile), and Windows using the basic win32 balloon API.</p>
            <p>OS X desktop notifications should be implemented in a future release.</p>

            <a name="bugs"></a>
            <h4>I've found a bug/have a feature request who do I tell?</h4>
            <p>If you have a github account, you can log an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/boothj5/profanity/issues?state=open" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>.</p>
            <p>Alternatively you are welcome to post on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/profanitydev" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.</p>
            <p>Finally you can email the project maintainer at boothj5web@gmail.com.</p>

            <a name="contrib"></a>
            <h4>I'd like to contribute, what should I do?</h4>
            <p>You can fork the <a href="https://github.com/boothj5/profanity" target="_blank">project on Github</a> and try to fix an <a href="https://github.com/boothj5/profanity/issues?state=open" target="_blank">issue</a> or add a feature.</p>
            <p>The XMPP standard has many features and <a href="http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/" target="_blank">extensions</a> that are not yet implemented in Profanity, so you could try to tackle one of those.</p>
            <p>Feel free to post on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/profanitydev" target="_blank">mailing list</a> if you have questions, or just email the project maintainer at boothj5web@gmail.com if you don't know where to start.</p>

            <a name="upgrade"></a>
            <h4>Why after upgrading from 0.1.9 to a later version isn't my configuration being picked up?</h4>
            <p>Configuration file locations have been changed to be compliant with the <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html" target="_blank">XDG Base Directory Specficiation</a> and some changes have been made to the format.</p>
            <p>Such non backwards compatible changes should be very rare in future but were required to make things more extensible from now on.</p>
            <p>Details of the new configuration file locations can be found <a href="files.html">here</a> and the commands used to manipulate the settings <a href="configuration.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The simplest way to get your configuration back (there were only a few options in 0.1.9) is to start Profanity after upgrading and use the commands to set your desired options.</p>
            <p>Since <a href="themes.html">basic colour themes</a> are now supported, colours are no longer specified in the main configuration file, so you will need to create a theme as shown in the link.</p>
